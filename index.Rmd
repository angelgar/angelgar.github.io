I'm an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics in the [Department of Epidemiology and Population Health](https://www.einsteinmed.edu/departments/epidemiology-population-health/) at Albert Einstein College of Medicine [Albert Einstein College of Medicine](https://www.einsteinmed.edu). I'm interested in the analysis of high-dimensional datasets in neuroscience, neurology, and psychiatry. 

I completed my B.A. in Mathematics at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) in 2015 and my Ph.D. in Biostatistics at [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu) in 2022. My dissertation, advised by [Jeff Goldsmith](https://jeffgoldsmith.com), focused on dimension reduction methodology for functional data and machine learning applications to epidemiologic surveys.
