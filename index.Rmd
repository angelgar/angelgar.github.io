### Biostatistics Ph.D. student, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health

<img src="images/angelgarciadelagarza_3.jpg" style="width:40%">

I'm a second year Biostatistics PhD Student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I completed my B.A. in Mathematics at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) in 2015. I previously worked as a data analyst at the [Brain and Behavioral Lab](http://www.med.upenn.edu/bbl/) at Penn. I'm interested in brain imaging statistics and the analysis of high dimensional data.
